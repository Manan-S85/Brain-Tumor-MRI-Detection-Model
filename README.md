# Brain Tumor MRI Detection using CNN & DenseNet121

## Overview
```
This repository contains a deep learning model designed for the detection of brain tumors in MRI scans. The model utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with DenseNet121 as the backbone to extract meaningful features from MRI images.

The model has been trained on a labeled dataset consisting of MRI scans categorized into four distinct classes: glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary tumor.
By leveraging deep learning techniques, it can effectively classify MRI images into these categories, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

Extensive preprocessing techniques such as image normalization, data augmentation, and contrast enhancement have been applied to improve the model's performance.
The dataset has been carefully curated to ensure balanced class distribution, reducing bias and enhancing the modelâ€™s generalization ability.
